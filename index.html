    <h1>Biography</h1>
    <p>
      I began my journey as a photographer after experiencing a short trip to
      the Mara game reserve about two years. I managed to interact with one of
      the local photographers. He gave me his camera, I shot a couple of photos
      which really took me by surprise and quite seamlessly everything that
      happened afterwards vis history. I managed to secure a scholarship to
      England where I pursued a course in photography. Afterwards I got an
      inclination to shooting vehicles.
